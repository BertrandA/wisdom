== Wisdom Modules

Wisdom is extensible by nature, meaning that you can extend the feature offered by Wisdom. This section enumerates
Wisdom's extension you can add.

There are two different type of extensions:

* _runtime_ extensions adding services and features at runtime (as a mail service)
* _build process_ extensions added processing capabilities (as the asciidoc-support)
